### Architectural Decisions

-   **Why Go for the backend?**

    performance. especially thinking about a serverless deployment. starts up incredibly fast and doesn't hog memory. For an API that needs to be responsive, and where multiple users might be making requests at once, Go's built-in handling of concurrency is a huge performance advantage

-   **Why Next.js for the frontend?**

    intuitive and easy to work with. amazing documentation. It also gives you server-side rendering out of the box, so the app feels fast for users from the very first page load. Also deploying it on Vercel is amazingly easy

-   **Why Firestore for the database?**

    real-time capabilities and cost. For a shared app like this, when one partner adds an event, the other should see it instantly without needing to refresh. Being a serverless NoSQL database, I don't have to manage servers. Very generous free tier

-   **Why Cloudflare R2 for file storage?**

    avoiding the bandwidth bills. R2 has zero egress fees, which means I'm not charged when users view the images they've uploaded. For a platform that's meant to be media-rich, had to go with R2. It also uses the same S3-compatible API as AWS, so I could use well-documented tools
